abstract = {In a world increasingly connected, and in which information flows quickly and affects a very large number of people, sentiment analysis has seen a spectacular development over the past ten years. This is due to the fact that the explosion of social networks has allowed anyone with internet access to publicly express his opinion. Moreover, the emergence of big data has brought enormous opportunities and powerful storage and analytics tools to the field of sentiment analysis. However, big data introduces new variables and constraints that could radically affect the traditional models of sentiment analysis. Therefore, new concerns, such as big data quality, have to be addressed to get the most out of big data. To the best of our knowledge, no contributions have been published so far which address big data quality in SA throughout its different processes. In this paper, we first highlight the most important big data quality metrics to consider in any big data project. Then, we show how these metrics could be specifically considered in SA approaches and this for each phase in the big data value chain.},

abstract = {In recent years, as more and more data sources have become available and the volumes of data potentially accessible have increased, the assessment of data quality has taken a central role whether at the academic, professional or any other sector. Given that users are often concerned with the need to filter a large amount of data to better satisfy their requirements and needs, and that data analysis can be based on inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, duplicated and of poor quality, it makes everyone wonder what the results of these analyses will really be like. However, there is a very complex process involved in the identification of new, valid, potentially useful and meaningful data from a large data collection and various information systems, and is critically dependent on a number of measures to be developed to ensure data quality. To this end, the main objective of this paper is to introduce a general study on data quality related with big data, by providing what other researchers came up with on that subject. The paper will be finalized by a comparative study between the different existing data quality models.},

Existing definitions of Big Data define Big Data by comparison with existing, usually relational, definitions, or define Big Data in terms of data characteristics or use an approach which combines data characteristics with the Big Data environment. In this paper we examine existing definitions of Big Data and discuss the strengths and limitations of the different approaches, with particular reference to issues related to data quality in Big Data. We identify the issues presented by incomplete or inconsistent definitions. We propose an alternative definition and relate this definition to our work on quality in Big Data.},

abstract = {Big Data (BD) solutions are designed to better support decision-making processes in order to optimize organizational performance. These BD solutions use company’s core business data, using typically large datasets. However, data that doesn’t meet adequate quality levels will lead to BD solutions that will not produce useful results, and consequently may not be used to make adequate business decisions. For a long time, companies have collected and stored large amounts of data without being able to exploit the advantage of exploring it. Nowadays, and thanks to the Big Data explosion, organizations have begun to recognize the need for estimating the value of their data and, vice-versa, managing data accordingly to their value. This need of managing the Value of data has led to the concept of Smart Data. It not only involves the datasets, but also the set of technologies, tools, processes and methodologies that enable all the Values from the data to the End-users (Business, data scientist, BI…). Consequently, Smart data is data actionable. We discovered that data quality is one of the most important issues when it comes to “smartizing” data. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to make data smarter, taking as a reference point, the quality level of the data itself.},

abstract = {Big data are a data trend present around us mainly through Internet -- social networks and smart devices and meters -- mostly without us being aware of them. Also they are a fact that both industry and scientific research needs to deal with. They are interesting from analytical point of view, for they contain knowledge that cannot be ignored and left unused. Traditional system that supports the advanced analytics and knowledge extraction -- data warehouse -- is not able to cope with large amounts of fast incoming various and unstructured data, and may be facing a paradigm shift in terms of utilized concepts, technologies and methodologies, which have become a very active research area in the last few years. This paper provides an overview of research trends important for the big data warehousing, concepts and technologies used for data storage and (ETL) processing, and research approaches done in attempts to empower traditional data warehouses for handling big data.},

abstract = {Compared to the traditional data storing, processing, analyzing and visualization which have been performed, Big data requires evolutionary technologies of massive data processing on distributed and parallel systems, such as Hadoop system. Big data analytic systems, thus, have been popular to derive important decision making in various areas. However, visualization on analytic system faces various limitation due to the huge amount of data. This brings the necessity of interactive visualization techniques beyond the traditional static visualization. R has been used and improved for a big data analysis and mining tool. Also, R is supported with various and abundant packages for different targets with visualization. However interactive visualization packages are not easily found in the market. This paper compares and analyzes interactive web packages with visualization packages for R. This paper also proposes interactive web visualized analysis environment for big data with a combination of interactive web packages and visualization packages. In particular, Big data analysis techniques with sensed data are presented as the result by reflecting the decision view on sensing field.},

It then presents a value discovery method, called Eco-ARCH (Eco-ARCHitecture), tightly integrated with the BDD (Big Data Design) method for addressing these requirements, filling a methodological void. Eco-ARCH promotes a fundamental shift in design thinking for big data system design -- from "bounded rationality" for problem solving to "expandable rationality" for design for innovation. The Eco-ARCH approach is most suitable for big data value engineering when system boundaries are fluid, requirements are ill-defined, many stakeholders are unknown and design goals are not provided, where no architecture pre-exists, where system behavior is non-deterministic and continuously evolving, and where co-creation with consumers and prosumers is essential to achieving innovation goals. The method was augmented and empirically validated in collaboration with an IT service company in the energy industry to generate a new business model that we call "eBay in the Grid".},

We therefore selected an outsourcing company who has successfully deployed big data projects for our study. Our research results from analyzing 10 outsourced big data projects provide a glimpse into early adopters of big data, illuminates the challenges for system development that stem from the 5Vs of big data and crystallizes the importance of architecture design choices and technology selection. We followed a collaborative practice research (CPR) method to develop and validate a new method, called BDD. BDD is the first attempt to systematically combine architecture design with data modeling approaches to address big data system development challenges. The use of reference architectures and a technology catalog are advancements to architecture design methods and are proving to be well-suited for big data system architecture design and system development.},

Such systems pose specific challenges in all phases of software development lifecycle and might become very complex by evolving data, technologies, and target value over time. Consequently, many organizations and enterprises have found it difficult to adopt BDSs. In this article, we provide insight into three major activities of software engineering in the context of BDSs as well as the choices made to tackle them regarding state-of-the-art research and industry efforts. These activities include the engineering of requirements, designing and constructing software to meet the specified requirements, and software/data quality assurance. We also disclose some open challenges of developing effective BDSs, which need attention from both researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {Generating value from big data is a task that requires models’ preparation and use of advanced technologies but which, above all, is based on the ability to extract, manage and analyse data. These processes’ effectiveness depends on the data's quality and their structured or unstructured nature. We are witnessing a growing number of applications based on unstructured data mining in the accounting and management fields. This research aims to demonstrating that despite the traditional association between accounting and quantitative analyses (expected to be based mainly on structured financial data). The findings show that several useful applications now rely on unstructured data in this field. A basic analysis of the cybersecurity risks is also presented, along with mitigating strategies to allow companies to comply with current regulations such as the GDPR. The result might appear surprising from the business perspective, but it is not from a data science perspective. In conclusion the growing number of unsctructured data business applications should orientate a better understanding of their potential and target better training of finance specialist on data processing skills.},

abstract = {Business analytics, occupying the intersection of the worlds of management science, computer science and statistical science, is a potent force for innovation in both the private and public sectors. The successes of business analytics in strategy, process optimization and competitive advantage has led to data being increasingly recognized as a valuable asset in many organizations. In recent years, thanks to a dramatic increase in the volume, variety and velocity of data, the loosely defined concept of "Big Data" has emerged as a topic of discussion in its own right -- with different viewpoints in both the business and technical worlds. From our perspective, it is important for discussions of "Big Data" to start from a well-defined business goal, and remain moored to fundamental principles of both cost/benefit analysis as well as core statistical science. This note discusses some business case considerations for analytics projects involving "Big Data", and proposes key questions that businesses should ask. With practical lessons from Big Data deployments in business, we also pose a number of research challenges that may be addressed to enable the business analytics community bring best data analytic practices when confronted with massive data sets.},

abstract = {The application of Big Data Techniques (BDT) in discrete manufacturing appears to be very promising, considering lighthouse projects in this area. In general, the goal is to collect all data from manufacturing systems comprehensively, in order to enable new findings and decision support by means of appropriate Industrial Big Data (IBD) analysis procedures. However, due to limited human and economic resources, potential IBD projects need to get prioritized -- in the best case according to their cost-benefit ratio. Available methods for this purpose are insufficient, due to their limited ability to be operationalized, error-proneness, and lack of scientific evidence. In this paper, we discuss how cost-benefit-analysis frameworks can be applied to the preliminary selection of production use cases for the implementation of BDT in larger production systems. It supports the use case selection process from information about production needs, available BDT, and given condition(s) per use case. This concept paper attempts to consolidate the hitherto fragmented discourse on how to prioritize IBD projects, evaluates the challenges of prioritization in this field, and presents a prioritization concept to overcome these challenges.},

abstract = {In the Big Data era, machine learning has more potential to discover valuable insights from the data. As an important machine learning technique, Bayesian Network (BN) has been widely used to model probabilistic relationships among variables. To deal with the challenges of Big Data PN learning, we apply the techniques in distributed data-parallelism (DDP) and scientific workflow to the BN learning process. We first propose an intelligent Big Data pre-processing approach and a data quality score to measure and ensure the data quality and data faithfulness. Then, a new weight based ensemble algorithm is proposed to learn a BN structure from an ensemble of local results. To easily integrate the algorithm with DDP engines, such as Hadoop, we employ Kepler scientific workflow to build the whole learning process. We demonstrate how Kepler can facilitate building and running our Big Data BN learning application. Our experiments show good scalability and learning accuracy when running the application in real distributed environments.},

abstract = {The combination of data and technology is having a high impact on the way we live. The world is getting smarter thanks to the quantity of collected and analyzed data. However, it is necessary to consider that such amount of data is continuously increasing and it is necessary to deal with novel requirements related to variety, volume, velocity, and veracity issues. In this paper we focus on veracity that is related to the presence of uncertain or imprecise data: errors, missing or invalid data can compromise the usefulness of the collected values. In such a scenario, new methods and techniques able to evaluate the quality of the available data are needed. In fact, the literature provides many data quality assessment and improvement techniques, especially for structured data, but in the Big Data era new algorithms have to be designed. We aim to provide an overview of the issues and challenges related to Data Quality assessment in the Big Data scenario. We also propose a possible solution developed by considering a smart city case study and we describe the lessons learned in the design and implementation phases.},

abstract = {A huge amount of data is constantly being produced in the world. Data coming from the IoT, from scientific simulations, or from any other field of the eScience, are accumulated over historical data sets and set up the seed for future Big Data processing, with the final goal to generate added value and discover knowledge. In such computing processes, data are the main resource; however, organizing and managing data during their entire life cycle becomes a complex research topic. As part of this, Data LifeCycle (DLC) models have been proposed to efficiently organize large and complex data sets, from creation to consumption, in any field, and any scale, for an effective data usage and big data exploitation.Several DLC frameworks can be found in the literature, each one defined for specific environments and scenarios. However, we realized that there is no global and comprehensive DLC model to be easily adapted to different scientific areas. For this reason, in this paper we describe the Comprehensive Scenario Agnostic Data LifeCycle (COSA-DLC) model, a DLC model which: i) is proved to be comprehensive as it addresses the 6Vs challenges (namely Value, Volume, Variety, Velocity, Variability and Veracity; and ii), it can be easily adapted to any particular scenario and, therefore, fit the requirements of a specific scientific field. In this paper we also include two use cases to illustrate the ease of the adaptation in different scenarios. We conclude that the comprehensive scenario agnostic DLC model provides several advantages, such as facilitating global data management, organization and integration, easing the adaptation to any kind of scenario, guaranteeing good data quality levels and, therefore, saving design time and efforts for the scientific and industrial communities.},

Software systems that utilize such operational data (OD) to help with software design and maintenance activities are increasingly being built despite the difficulties of drawing valid conclusions from disparate and low-quality data and the continuing evolution of operational support tools. This paper proposes systematizing approaches to the engineering of OD-based systems. To prioritize and structure research areas we consider historic developments, such as big data hype; synthesize defining features of OD, such as confounded measures and unobserved context; and discuss emerging new applications, such as diverse and large OD collections and extremely short development intervals. To sustain the credibility of OD-based systems more research will be needed to investigate effective existing approaches and to synthesize novel, OD-specific engineering principles.},

Therefore, narrowing down on the fallouts in POF can provide evidence for managerial and policy interventions. This paper explores five-layer POF and its application with big data in university public opinion monitoring and processing. It reveals that big data technology can be actively employed to safeguard the image of university public opinion formation, but this can be inhibited by the lack of commitment to integrating multiple stakeholders on a common platform, privacy, and security concerns.

The proposed framework can be viewed as an alternative to classical approaches where the privacy of big data is ensured via security-inspired protocols that check several (protocol) layers in order to achieve the desired privacy. Unfortunately, this injects considerable computational overheads in the overall process, thus introducing relevant challenges to be considered. Our approach instead tries to recognize the "pedigree" of suitable summary data representatives computed on top of the target big data repositories, hence avoiding computational overheads due to protocol checking. We also provide a relevant realization of the framework above, the so-called Data-dRIven aggregate-PROvenance privacy-preserving big Multidimensional data (DRIPROM) framework, which specifically considers multidimensional data as the case of interest.},

abstract = {High-quality power data is the basis for reliable operation of power systems, efficient data processing, and effective mining of the potential value of power data. How to use big data, artificial intelligence and other technologies to evaluate the quality of power data is a hot research topic in the field of electric power. At present, most of the power data quality evaluation methods are simple and lack the research of general data quality evaluation model. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data quality evaluation model based on a multi-head attention mechanism. The model measures multiple indicators such as completeness, accuracy, smoothness, and correlation. The corresponding methods are used to quantify these indicators to form a data quality evaluation index system oriented to multi-dimensional indicators; then, an application feedback mechanism based on a multi-head attention network is used to correct the calculation weights and score outputs, so as to achieve the evaluation of power data quality. Finally, the validation analysis is carried out based on the electricity data of a region in China. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the quality of electric power data.},

abstract = {Class label noise is a critical component of data quality that directly inhibits the predictive performance of machine learning algorithms. While many data-level and algorithm-level methods exist for treating label noise, the challenges associated with big data call for new and improved methods. This survey addresses these concerns by providing an extensive literature review on treating label noise within big data. We begin with an introduction to the class label noise problem and traditional methods for treating label noise. Next, we present 30 methods for treating class label noise in a range of big data contexts, i.e. high volume, high variety, and high velocity problems. The surveyed works include distributed solutions capable of operating on data sets of arbitrary sizes, deep learning techniques for large-scale data sets with limited clean labels, and streaming techniques for detecting class noise in the presence of concept drift. Common trends and best practices are identified in each of these areas, implementation details are reviewed, empirical results are compared across studies when applicable, and references to 17 open-source projects and programming packages are provided. An emphasis on label noise challenges, solutions, and empirical results as they relate to big data distinguishes this work as a unique contribution that will inspire future research and guide machine learning practitioners.},

The census agencies are at varying stages in digitally transforming their national census process, products and services through assimilating and using big data and big data analytics. The cross-case analysis of government websites and documents identified emerging agency challenges in creating public value in the national census context: (1) big data analytics capability development, (2) cross agency data access and data integration, and (3) data security, privacy &amp; trust. Based on the insights gained, a research model aims to postulate the possible links among challenges, big data/big data analytics use, and public value creation.},

abstract = {Currently, the generated data flow is growing at a high rate resulting to the problem of data obesity and abundance, but yet a lack of pertinent information. To handle this Big Data, Hadoop is a distributed framework that facilitates data storage and processing. Although Hadoop is designed to deal with demands of storage and analysis of ever-growing Data, its performance characteristics are still to improve. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed to enhance Hadoop capabilities. Nevertheless, an overview of these approaches shows that several aspects need to be improved in terms of performance and data relevancy. The main challenge is how to extract efficiently value from the big data sources. For this purpose, we propose in this paper to discuss Hadoop architecture and intelligent data discovery, and propose an effective on-demand Big Data contribution enabling to process relevant data in efficient and effective way according to the stakeholder's needs, and aiming to boost Data appointment by integrating multidimensional approach.},

abstract = {Proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor technology has expedited the realization of Smart City. To enable necessary functions, sensors distributed across the city generate a huge volume of stream data that are crucial for controlling Smart City devices. However, due to conditions such as wears and tears, battery drain, or malicious attacks, not all data are reliable even when they are accurately measured. These data could lead to invalid and devastating consequences (e.g., failed utility or transportation services). The assessment of data reliability is necessary and challenging especially for Smart City, as it has to keep up with velocity of big data stream to provide up-to-date results. Most research on data reliability has focused on data fusion and anomaly detection that lack a quantified measure of how much the data over a period of time are adequately reliable for decision-makings. This paper alleviates these issues and presents an online approach to assessing Big stream data reliability in a timely manner. By employing a well-studied evidence-based theory, our approach provides a computational framework that assesses data reliability in terms of belief likelihoods. The framework is lightweight and easy to scale, deeming fit for streaming data. We evaluate the approach using a real application of light sensing data of 1,323,298 instances. The preliminary results are consistent with logical rationales, confirming validity of the approach.},

abstract = {Data quality and especially the assessment of data quality have been intensively discussed in research and practice alike. To support an economically oriented management of data quality and decision making under uncertainty, it is essential to assess the data quality level by means of well-founded metrics. However, if not adequately defined, these metrics can lead to wrong decisions and economic losses. Therefore, based on a decision-oriented framework, we present a set of five requirements for data quality metrics. These requirements are relevant for a metric that aims to support an economically oriented management of data quality and decision making under uncertainty. We further demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of these requirements by evaluating five data quality metrics for different data quality dimensions. Moreover, we discuss practical implications when applying the presented requirements.},

We have deployed this churn prediction system in one of the biggest mobile operators in China. From millions of active customers, this system can provide a list of prepaid customers who are most likely to churn in the next month, having $0.96$ precision for the top $50000$ predicted churners in the list.

abstract = {The collection and analysis of relevant data for evaluating public policies is not a straightforward task. An important type of such studies is the so-called ex-post evaluation. The main objective of ex-post evaluations is to determine to what extent a realized intervention is successful in tackling a societal challenge, e.g., youth unemployment. At a first glance an obvious method is to collect some baseline measurements for a set of relevant variables, apply the intervention for a while and collect the new measurement values for the same set of variables. Then, comparing the measurement values of the variables before and after the intervention provides an insight into the extent of successfulness of the intervention. This, however, is only true if the "ceteris paribus" condition holds. In practice it is infeasible to enforce this condition for societal challenges. Often, after having the baseline measurements, several phenomena emerge that may impact the new measurements without being taken into account. This makes it difficult to determine how much of the measured differences between the values of the variables before and after the intervention should be attributed to the emerging phenomena (or the so-called counterfactuals) and how much of the differences can be attributed to the applied intervention.This paper discusses how exploiting big data may contribute to the task of elucidating the influences of counterfactuals (and interventions) in ex-post evaluation studies. The paper proposes a framework to utilize big data for accounting for the impact of emerging phenomena in ex-post evaluation studies.},

abstract = {The benefits of deriving useful insights from avalanche of data available everywhere cannot be overemphasized. Big Data analytics can revolutionize the healthcare industry. It can also ensure functional productivity, help forecast and suggest feedbacks to disease outbreaks, enhance clinical practice, and optimize healthcare expenditure which cuts across all stakeholders in healthcare sectors. Notwithstanding these immense capabilities available in the general application of big data; studies on derivation of useful insights from healthcare data that can enhance medical practice have received little academic attention. Therefore, this study highlighted the possibility of making very insightful healthcare outcomes with big data through a simple classification problem which classifies the tendency of individuals towards specific drugs based on personality measures. Our model though trained with less than 2000 samples and with a simple neural network architecture achieved mean accuracies of 76.87% (sd=0.0097) and 75.86% (sd=0.0123) for the 0.15 and 0.05 validation sets respectively. The relatively acceptable performance recorded by our model despite the small dataset could largely be attributed to number of attributes in our dataset. It is essential to uncover some of the many complexities in our societies in relations to healthcare; and through many machine learning architectures like the neural networks these complex relationships can be discovered},
