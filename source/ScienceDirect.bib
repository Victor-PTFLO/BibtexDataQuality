abstract = {Big data analytics associated with database searching, mining, and analysis can be seen as an innovative IT capability that can improve firm performance. Even though some leading companies are actively adopting big data analytics to strengthen market competition and to open up new business opportunities, many firms are still in the early stage of the adoption curve due to lack of understanding of and experience with big data. Hence, it is interesting and timely to understand issues relevant to big data adoption. In this study, a research model is proposed to explain the acquisition intention of big data analytics mainly from the theoretical perspectives of data quality management and data usage experience. Our empirical investigation reveals that a firm's intention for big data analytics can be positively affected by its competence in maintaining the quality of corporate data. Moreover, a firm's favorable experience (i.e., benefit perceptions) in utilizing external source data could encourage future acquisition of big data analytics. Surprisingly, a firm's favorable experience (i.e., benefit perceptions) in utilizing internal source data could hamper its adoption intention for big data analytics.}

In particular, the amount of available information is constantly growing and organizations rely more and more on data analysis in order to achieve their competitive advantage. However, such amount of data can create a real value only if combined with quality: good decisions and actions are the results of correct, reliable and complete data. In such a scenario, methods and techniques for the Data Quality assessment can support the identification of suitable data to process. If for traditional database numerous assessment methods are proposed, in the Big Data scenario new algorithms have to be designed in order to deal with novel requirements related to variety, volume and velocity issues. In particular, in this paper we highlight that dealing with heterogeneous sources requires an adaptive approach able to trigger the suitable quality assessment methods on the basis of the data type and context in which data have to be used. Furthermore, we show that in some situations it is not possible to evaluate the quality of the entire dataset due to performance and time constraints. For this reason, we suggest to focus the Data Quality assessment only on a portion of the dataset and to take into account the consequent loss of accuracy by introducing a confidence factor as a measure of the reliability of the quality assessment procedure. We propose a methodology to build a Data Quality adapter module, which selects the best configuration for the Data Quality assessment based on the user main requirements: time minimization, confidence maximization, and budget minimization. Experiments are performed by considering real data gathered from a smart city case study.}

This is mainly because Big Data is not only about data, but also about a complete conceptual and technological stack including raw and processed data, storage, ways of managing data, processing and analytics. A challenge that becomes even trickier is the management of the quality of the data in Big Data environments. More than ever before the need for assessing the Quality-in-Use gains importance since the real contribution–business value–of data can be only estimated in its context of use. Although there exists different Data Quality models for assessing the quality of regular data, none of them has been adapted to Big Data. To fill this gap, we propose the “3As Data Quality-in-Use model”, which is composed of three Data Quality characteristics for assessing the levels of Data Quality-in-Use in Big Data projects: Contextual Adequacy, Operational Adequacy and Temporal Adequacy. The model can be integrated into any sort of Big Data project, as it is independent of any pre-conditions or technologies. The paper shows the way to use the model with a working example. The model accomplishes every challenge related to Data Quality program aimed for Big Data. The main conclusion is that the model can be used as an appropriate way to obtain the Quality-in-Use levels of the input data of the Big Data analysis, and those levels can be understood as indicators of trustworthiness and soundness of the results of the Big Data analysis.}

However, big data brings lots of “big errors” in data quality and data usage, which cannot be used as a substitute for sound research design and solid theories.

abstract = {Background
Activating prior medical knowledge in diagnosis and treatment is an important basis for clinicians to improve their care ability. However, it has not been systematically explained whether and how various big data resources affect the activation of prior knowledge in the big data environment faced by clinicians.
Objective
The aim of this study is to contribute to a better understanding on how the activation of prior knowledge of clinicians is affected by a wide range of shared and private big data resources, to reveal the impact of big data resources on clinical competence and professional development of clinicians.
Method
Through the comprehensive analysis of extant research results, big data resources are classified as big data itself, big data technology and big data services at the public and institutional levels. A survey was conducted on clinicians and IT personnel in Chinese hospitals. A total of 616 surveys are completed, involving 308 medical institutions. Each medical institution includes a clinician and an IT personnel. SmartPLS version 2.0 software package was used to test the direct impact of big data resources on the activation of prior knowledge. We further analyze their indirect impact of those big data resources without direct impact.
Results
(1) Big data quality environment at the institutional level and the big data sharing environment at the public level directly affect activation of prior medical knowledge; (2) Big data service environment at the institutional level directly affects activation of prior medical knowledge; (3) Big data deployment environment at the institutional level and big data service environment at the public level have no direct impact on activation of prior knowledge of clinicians, but they have an indirect impact through big data quality environment and service environment at the institutional level and the big data sharing environment at the public level.
Conclusions
Big data technology, big data itself and big data service at the public level and institutional level interact and influence each other to activate prior medical knowledge. This study highlights the implications of big data resources on improvement of clinicians’ diagnosis and treatment ability.}

The ability to effectively analyze this kind of information is now seen as a key competitive advantage to better inform decisions. In order to do so, organizations employ Sentiment Analysis (SA) techniques on these data. However, the usage of social media around the world is ever-increasing, which considerably accelerates massive data generation and makes traditional SA systems unable to deliver useful insights. Such volume of data can be efficiently analyzed using the combination of SA techniques and Big Data technologies. In fact, big data is not a luxury but an essential necessary to make valuable predictions. However, there are some challenges associated with big data such as quality that could highly affect the SA systems’ accuracy that use huge volume of data. Thus, the quality aspect should be addressed in order to build reliable and credible systems. For this, the goal of our research work is to consider Big Data Quality Metrics (BDQM) in SA that rely of big data. In this paper, we first highlight the most eloquent BDQM that should be considered throughout the Big Data Value Chain (BDVC) in any big data project. Then, we measure the impact of BDQM on a novel SA method accuracy in a real case study by giving simulation results.}

However, before the data can be used its quality must be determined and appropriate regions extracted. Initially, such testing was done manually using graphs or basic rules, such as the value of a variable. With large data sets, such an approach will not work, since the amount of data to tested and the number of potential rules is too large. Therefore, there is a need for automated segmentation of the data set into different components. Such an approach has recently been proposed and tested using various types of industrial data. Although the industrial results are promising, there still remain many unanswered questions including how to handle a priori knowledge, over- or undersegmentation of the data set, and setting the appropriate thresholds for a given application. Solving these problems will provide a robust and reliable method for determining the data quality of a given data set.}

Firstly, the architecture for distributed parallel data modeling is formulated under the MapReduce framework. Secondly, a big data quality prediction scheme is developed based on the distributed parallel data modeling approach. As an example, the basic Semi-Supervised Probabilistic Principal Component Regression (SSPPCR) model is deployed to concurrently train a set of local models with split datasets. Meanwhile, Bayesian rule is utilized in a MapReduce way to integrate local models based on their predictive abilities. Two case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for big data quality prediction.}

However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, which becomes a major factor that prevents them from being used for big data quality prediction. This is because the JIT modeling methods need to update the local regression model using the relevant samples that are searched through the lineal scan of the database during online operation. To solve this issue, the present work proposes a novel hashing-based JIT (HbJIT) modeling method that is suitable for big data quality prediction. In HbJIT, a family of locality-sensitive hash functions is firstly used to hash big data into a set of buckets, in which similar samples are grouped on themselves. During online prediction, HbJIT looks up multiple buckets that have a high probability of containing similar samples of a query object through the intelligent probing scheme, uses the data objects in the buckets as the candidate set of the results, and then filters the candidate objects using a linear scan. After filtering, the most relevant samples are used to construct the local regression model to yield the prediction of the query object. By integrating the multi-probe hashing strategy into the JIT learning framework, HbJIT can not only deal with process nonlinearity and time-varying characteristics but also is applicable to large-scale industrial processes. Experimental results on real-world dataset have demonstrated that the proposed HbJIT is time-efficient in processing large-scale datasets, and greatly reduces the online prediction time without compromising on the prediction accuracy.}

Systematic, large-scale, studies at the genomic, metabolomic, and functional level have transformed the natural product sciences. Improvements in technology and reduction in cost for obtaining spectroscopic, chromatographic, and genomic data coupled with the creation of readily accessible curated and functionally annotated data sets have altered the practices of virtually all natural product research laboratories. Gone are the days when the natural products researchers were expected to devote themselves exclusively to the isolation, purification, and structure elucidation of small molecules. We now also engage with big data in taxonomic, genomic, proteomic, and/or metabolomic collections, and use these data to generate and test hypotheses. While the oft stated aim for the use of large-scale -omics data in the natural products sciences is to achieve a rapid increase in the rate of discovery of new drugs, this has not yet come to pass. At the same time, new technologies have provided unexpected opportunities for natural products chemists to ask and answer new and different questions. With this viewpoint, we discuss the evolution of big data as a part of natural products research and provide a few examples of how discoveries have been enabled by access to big data. We also draw attention to some of the limitations in our existing engagement with large datasets and consider what would be necessary to overcome them.}

Moreover, the proposed data trading system evaluates the data quality on the basis of three metrics, records the evaluation results in a side-chain, and distributes the data users’ application revenue to the data provider according to the evaluated data quality.

Therefore, many firms defer collecting and integrating big data as they have concerns regarding the impact of utilizing big data on data diagnosticity (i.e., retrieval of valuable information from data) and firm decision making quality. In this study, we use the Organizational Learning Theory and Wang and Strong's data quality framework to explore the impact of processing big data on firm decision quality and the mediating role of data quality (DQ) and data diagnosticity on this relationship. We validate the proposed research model using survey data from 130 firms, obtained from data analysts and IT managers. Results confirm the critical role of DQ in increasing data diagnosticity and improving firm decision quality when processing big data; suggesting important implications for practice and theory. Findings also reveal that while big data utilization positively impacts contextual DQ, accessibility DQ, and representational DQ, interestingly, it negatively impacts intrinsic DQ. Furthermore, findings show that while intrinsic DQ, contextual DQ, and representational DQ significantly increase data diagnosticity, accessibility DQ does not influence it. Most importantly, the findings show that big data utilization does not significantly impact the quality of firm decisions and it is fully mediated through DQ and data diagnosticity. The results of this study contribute to practice by providing important guidelines for managers to improve firm decision quality through the use of big data.}

abstract = {In the big data era, large amounts of data are under generation and accumulation in various industries. However, users usually feel hindered by the data quality issues when extracting values from the big data. Thus, data quality issues are gaining more and more attention from data quality management analysts. Cutting-edge solutions like data ETL, data cleaning, and data quality monitoring systems have many deficiencies in capability and efficiency, making it difficult to cope with complicated situations on big data. These problems inspire us to build SparkDQ, a generic distributed data quality management model and framework that provides a series of data quality detection and repair interfaces. Users can quickly build custom tasks of data quality computing for various needs by utilizing these interfaces. In addition, SparkDQ implements a set of algorithms that in a parallel manner with optimizations. These algorithms aim at various data quality goals. We also propose several system-level optimizations, including the job-level optimization with multi-task execution scheduling and the data-level optimization with data state caching. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed distributed algorithms in SparkDQ run up to 12 times faster compared to the corresponding stand-alone serial and multi-thread algorithms. Compared with the cutting-edge distributed data quality solution Apache Griffin, SparkDQ has more features, and its execution time is only around half of Apache Griffin on average. SparkDQ achieves near-linear data and node scalability.}

abstract = {The essence of an information system lies in the data; if it is not of good quality or not sufficiently protected, the consequences will undoubtedly be harmful. Quality and Security are two essential aspects that add value to data and their implementation has become a real need and must be adopted before any data exploitation. Due to the high volume of data, their diversity and their rapid generation, effective implementation of such systems requires well thought out mechanisms and strategies. This paper provides an overview of Data Quality and Data Security in a Big Data context. We want through this paper to highlight the conflicts that may exist during the implementation of data security and data quality management systems. Such a conflict makes the complexity greater and requires new adapted solutions.}

Despite the emergence of novel data quality processing tools, there is a dearth of studies assessing performance and scalability in the execution of data quality assessment tasks during query processing. This paper reports on an empirical study aiming to investigate the extent to which a big data computing framework (Spark) can offer significant gains in performance and scalability when executing data quality querying tasks over a range of computational platforms including a single commodity multi-core machine and a cluster-based platform for a wide range of workloads. Our results show that substantial performance and scalability gains can be obtained by using optimized data science libraries combined with the parallel and distributed capabilities of big data computing. We also provide guidelines on choosing the appropriate computational infrastructure for executing DQ-aware queries.}

abstract = {Battery is one of the most important and costly devices in electric vehicles (EVs). Developing an efficient battery management method is of great significance to enhancing vehicle safety and economy. Recently developed big-data and cloud platform computing technologies bring a bright perspective for efficient utilization and protection of vehicle batteries. However, a reliable data transmission network and a high-quality cloud battery dataset are indispensable to enable this benefit. This paper makes the first effort to systematically solve data quality problems in cloud-based vehicle battery monitoring and management by developing a novel integrated battery data cleaning framework. In the first stage, the outlier samples are detected by analyzing the temporal features in the battery data time series. The outlier data in the dataset can be accurately detected to avoid their impacts on battery monitoring and management. Then, the abnormal samples, including the noise polluted data and missing value, are restored by a novel future fusion data restoring model. The real electric bus operation data collected by a cloud-based battery monitoring and management platform are used to verify the performance of the developed data cleaning method. More than 93.3% of outlier samples can be detected, and the data restoring error can be limited to 2.11%, which validates the effectiveness of the developed methods. The proposed data cleaning method provides an effective data quality assessment tool in cloud-based vehicle battery management, which can further boost the practical application of the vehicle big data platform and Internet of vehicle.}

Moreover, market risk management capability (MRM) enhances ARS, and data quality moderates the relationship between big data analytics usage (BDU) and MRM. This research reveals the impact mechanism of BDU on the ARS. Implications for management and future research are presented as well.}

abstract = {Data quality (DQ) assessment is essential for realizing the promise of big data by judging the value of data in advance. Relevance, an indispensable dimension of DQ, focusing on “fitness for requirement”, can arouse the user’s interest in exploiting the data source. It has two-level evaluations: (1) the amount of data that meets the user’s requirements; (2) the matching degree of these relevant data. However, there lack works of DQ assessment at dimension of relevance, especially for unstructured image data which focus on semantic similarity. When we try to evaluate semantic relevance between an image data source and a query (requirement), there are three challenges: (1) how to extract semantic information with generalization ability for all image data? (2) how to quantify relevance by fusing the quantity of relevant data and the degree of similarity comprehensively? (3) how to improve assessing efficiency of relevance in a big data scenario by design of an effective architecture? To overcome these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware data quality assessment (SDQA) architecture which includes off-line analysis and on-line assessment. In off-line analysis, for an image data source, we first transform all images into hash codes using our improved Deep Self-taught Hashing (IDSTH) algorithm which can extract semantic features with generalization ability, then construct a graph using hash codes and restricted Hamming distance, next use our designed Semantic Hash Ranking (SHR) algorithm to calculate the importance score (rank) for each node (image), which takes both the quantity of relevant images and the degree of semantic similarity into consideration, and finally rank all images in descending order of score. During on-line assessment, we first convert the user’s query into hash codes using IDSTH model, then retrieve matched images to collate their importance scores, and finally help the user determine whether the image data source is fit for his requirement. The results on public dataset and real-world dataset show effectiveness, superiority and on-line efficiency of our SDQA architecture.}

abstract = {The introduction and use of ‘big data and analytics’ is an on-going issue of discussion in health sectors globally. Healthcare systems of developed countries are trying to create more value and better healthcare through data and use of big data technologies. With an increasing number of articles identifying the value creation of big data and analytics for clinical decision-making, this paper examines how big data is applied, or not applied, in clinical practice. Using social representation theory as a theoretical foundation the paper explores people's perceptions of big data across all levels (policy making, planning, funding, and clinical care) of the New Zealand healthcare sector. The findings show that although adoption of big data technologies is planned for population health and health management, the potential of big data for clinical care has yet to be explored in the New Zealand context. The findings also highlight concern over data quality. The paper provides recommendations for policy and practice particularly around the need for engagement and participation of all levels to discuss data quality as well as big-data-based changes such as precision medicine and technology-assisted clinical decision-making tools. Future avenues of research are suggested.}
