abstract={The poor quality of a dataset may produce low quality machine learning system. Therefore, transfer learning as a demonstrated effective approach for data quality improvement has been widely used for improving the quality of machine learning. However, the "quality improvement" brought by transfer learning in some studies was not rigorously validated or was even misleading. In this paper, we first investigate the quality problem of the datasets that were used for building a machine learning system. The system was claimed to have achieved the best performance comparing to existing work on a machine learning task. However, the "best performance" was due to the poor quality of the datasets as well as the incorrect validation process. Then we described an experimental study to demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning for improving the quality of datasets. However, the experiment results also show the quality improvement of transfer learning is not guaranteed, and a set of requirements have to be meet before applying the approach. Based on the investigation and experiment results, we propose a group of data quality criteria and evaluation approaches for quality improvement of machine learning. We investigated the research problem and explained the results through studying a machine learning system for normalizing medical concepts in social media text with open datasets.},

abstract={Because of the development of the social economy, people's living standards are also constantly improving recent years. The effect of weather forecast on social economy is more and more important, which has a great influence on agricultural production and personal life. With the advancement of the observation automati-on business, small disturbances may cause systematic errors in observation data. The meteorological observation data's quality is an important factor that directly affects the accuracy of weather forecast and climate forecast. The traditional quality control algorithm uses the climatological limit value of historical data and the allowable value of elements to check, lacks sensitivity to elements fancy changes, and not suitable for demend of quality control. This paper introduces a quality control project of multi-source weather observation based on data mining. Starting from the correlation between the observations of the alike observation element which is not at the same time (time correlation), and the correlation between unlike observation elements at the same time (element correlation), combined with the relevant algorithms in data mining, the paper proposes Two different quality control methods for multi-source meteorological observation data, combined with the complementarity and correlation of the two methods, a synthetic quality control programme is established.},

abstract={Linked Open Data (LOD) entails a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the Web, which allows sharing and exchanging information in an inter-operable and reusable manner. The increasing adoption of these principles has lead to the creation of a globally distributed and huge informative space that covers various domains such as government, libraries, life sciences, and media. This offers a great opportunity to end-users to build semantic applications by exploring and consuming heterogeneous and dispersed possibly interlinked data. Thus, consuming linked data can be considered as a typical scenario of linked data integration in which a user requires to combine data residing in large and varying quality LOD datasets.In this paper, we examine the specifics of linked data integration and focus on three key challenges, namely data quality profiling and assessment, conflict resolution and quality improvement. We postulate that data quality assessment can act both as a deciding factor for conflict resolution and as an indicator of low quality data which need to be improved.},

abstract={Data/information quality (DQ/IQ*) has great impact on data consumers’ decisions. In order to provide high quality data/information, data consumers’ requirements for DQ/IQ have to be analyzed and identified. Right requirement identification is fundamental to data quality control activities including DQ/IQ measurement, evaluation, improvement, etc. Quality function deployment (QFD) and the house of quality (HOQ) are effective tools to translate consumers’ requirements into specific DQ dimensions for DQ improvement. This work briefly introduces QFD, HOQ and their constitutive elements. Data consumers are also examined. A methodology of applying HOQ in DQ/IQ, which includes five major steps, is described in details. Then an example of product design information quality is presented. By using the methodology, the weak points of DQ in industrial firms can be identified in the form of DQ dimensions in order to take actions to improve data/information quality.},

abstract={Data quality is a critical problem in modern databases. data-entry forms present the first and arguably best opportunity for detecting and mitigating errors, but there has been little research into automatic methods for improving data quality at entry time. In this paper, we propose Usher, an end-to-end system for form design, entry, and data quality assurance. Using previous form submissions, Usher learns a probabilistic model over the questions of the form. Usher then applies this model at every step of the data-entry process to improve data quality. Before entry, it induces a form layout that captures the most important data values of a form instance as quickly as possible and reduces the complexity of error-prone questions. During entry, it dynamically adapts the form to the values being entered by providing real-time interface feedback, reasking questions with dubious responses, and simplifying questions by reformulating them. After entry, it revisits question responses that it deems likely to have been entered incorrectly by reasking the question or a reformulation thereof. We evaluate these components of Usher using two real-world data sets. Our results demonstrate that Usher can improve data quality considerably at a reduced cost when compared to current practice.},

abstract={Financial Regulatory Authority implements Integrated Reporting to improve data quality which is very important because this report will be input for making monetary and macroprudential policies. Data assessment is needed to fulfill the needs of standardization of data quality. The objective of this research is to analyze the quality of critical data from the Integrated Reporting for the monthly period that is reported to the financial regulatory authorities based on the dimensions that are used to perform measurements. There are 4 dimensions of data quality used to define the data quality requirements in this Financial Regulatory Authority, which are completeness, accuracy, currency, and timeliness. To analyze the data, a specific framework for financial data was chosen which is Quality Assessment on Financial Data (QAFD) framework with slight modification. The result of the objective assessment from 48 variables for the completeness dimension is 100% for the mandatory variable, the dimensions of syntactic accuracy and accuracy that related to precision and validity show 100% results but the semantic accuracy for loan, time deposit, and demand deposit shows the percentage of 81.77%, 85.04% and 81.22%, currency dimension is 96.93% and timeliness dimension is 80.89%. Comparison between objective and subjective assessments from 6 variables as a sample shows that there is still a discrepancy for the currency and accuracy dimensions, while the completeness and timeliness dimensions are aligned between objective and subjective assessments. Based on the results of this study, recommendations were made to regulators to improve data quality.},

The lack of precise standards and algorithmic techniques are considered as two major problems for data quality assessment. To prevent causes of data quality problems is a new issue, which can remarkably reduce costs imposed by the quality loss in information systems. The present paper introduced a computational approach to detect success/failure of the precautionary process. Through studying different parts of the process and assessing its good point, a distinct algorithm was presented. Generally, there are various types of information systems due to the lack of a single organizational and information standard. Therefore, the proposed algorithms can be specialized for each given information system.},

First, the original power quality data was sampled and compressed simultaneously by random matrix projection method based on compressed sampling theorem. Then the proposed adaptive matching pursuit reconstruction algorithm was used to achieve accurate power quality data reconstruction. The proposed method breaks through the traditional framework of data compression by merging compression into sampling process and could reconstruct original power quality data from the small amount of sampling points from the compressed data.

abstract={Blockchain's popularity has changed the way people think about data access, storage, and retrieval. Because of this, many classic data management challenges are imbued with renewed significance. One such challenge is the issue of Dynamic Data Quality. As time passes, data changes in content and structure and thus becomes dynamic. Data quality, therefore, also becomes dynamic because it is an aggregate characteristic of the changing content and changing structure of data itself. But blockchain is a static structure. The friction between static blockchains and Dynamic Data Quality give rise to new research opportunities, which the authors address in this paper.},

abstract={With the continuous development of flight test technology, the test system is filled with massive, multi-structured, and multi-dimensional data resources. The value of big data has been fully recognized by the society. How to tap the value of data has become an application in various research fields and industries. The most concerned issue of the field. Whether the data is rubbish or treasure, the most important question is whether the data to be analyzed and mined is of high quality. A low-quality data source will not only fail to reflect the value of the data, but may also run counter to the actual situation, which has side effects. In order to effectively evaluate the quality of flight test data, according to the characteristics of test data in flight test, a test data quality evaluation method based on rough set theory is proposed, standard test methods and test indicators for flight test data quality are proposed, and data quality evaluation is given. The method of rule extraction realizes the quality evaluation of flight test data.},

abstract={Modern information systems consist of many distributed computer and database systems. The integration of such distributed data into a single data warehouse system is confronted with the well known problem of low data quality. In this paper we present an approach that facilitates a dynamic identification of spurious and error-prone data stored in a large data warehouse. The identification of data quality problems is based on data mining techniques, such as clustering, subspace clustering and classification. Furthermore, we present via a case study the applicability of our approach on real data. The experimental results show that our approach efficiently identifies data quality problems.},

abstract={The W3C Data on the Web Best Practices Working Group is standardizing the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) for expressing data quality of Web-published datasets. As proposed in the DQV specification, quality annotations on datasets, one kind of quality information described using DQV, are achieved through Web annotations. Meanwhile, the W3C Web Annotation Working Group is creating a standard Web Annotation Data Model on the basis of the Open Annotation (OA) Data Model. Despite the significant progress in standardization, there is a lack of systematic research on Web tools for DQV-based dataset quality annotation. This paper therefore proposes a Dataset Quality Annotation Framework (DQAF) that provides annotating users with an interactive visual user interface, through which DQV-based dataset quality annotation can be readily achieved using the OA data model to produce machine-readable quality annotation data. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of DQAF and conducted case study experiments with the prototype. The results indicate that DQAF is feasible and implementable, and annotating users can obtain a better understanding of and more intuitive interaction with the quality annotation data by means of the user interface.},

abstract={In the recent decade, online learning environments have accumulated millions of Open Educational Resources (OERs). However, for learners, finding relevant and high quality OERs is a complicated and time-consuming activity. Furthermore, metadata play a key role in offering high quality services such as recommendation and search. Metadata can also be used for automatic OER quality control as, in the light of the continuously increasing number of OERs, manual quality control is getting more and more difficult. In this work, we collected the metadata of 8,887 OERs to perform an exploratory data analysis to observe the effect of quality control on metadata quality. Subsequently, we propose an OER metadata scoring model, and build a metadata-based prediction model to anticipate the quality of OERs. Based on our data and model, we were able to detect high-quality OERs with the F1 score of 94.6%.},

abstract={Forecasts of daily pollutant levels have become a standard part of weather predictions in television, on-line, and in newspapers. Research groups also need to analyze larger timeframes across more locations to correlate long term developments for different pollutants with multiple serious health effects such as asthma. This paper presents a comparison of the Hadoop MapReduce and Spark programing models for air quality simulations, guiding future code development for the research groups interested in these analyses. Two use cases have been used, namely (i) calculating the eight hour rolling average of pollutants in a restricted region, (ii) identifying clusters of sensors showing similar patterns in pollutant concentration over multiple years in the state of Texas. The data set used in this analysis is air pollution data collected over fifteen years at 179 monitor sites across the state of Texas for a variety of pollutants. Our results reveal 20-25% performance benefits for the Spark solutions over MapReduce. Furthermore, it documents performance benefits of the Spark MLlib machine learning library over the Mahout library which is based on the MapReduce programing model.},

pages={1600-1607},
abstract={Data analytics is the process of analyzing raw data to make predictions and derive conclusions. This process involves collecting and organizing data to discover hidden patterns and draw insight into the data. The methods and approaches of data analytics are automated using various algorithms and mathematical formulas. Data analytics provides real-time and actionable perceptions on data that enable more accurate and prompter decision-making. During the data acquisition phase, missing values and outliers are encountered that affect the model's reliability. Missing values are the data missing in a dataset, more common on large datasets that arise due to information loss, dropout, or non-response of participants. Missing values affects the accuracy of the result and also may lead to biased results. Outliers are the abnormal values that happen to have deviated from the normal distribution pattern of data distribution. Outliers are extreme, unrealistic, extremely big, or small values in a dataset that arise due to manual errors like participant response errors and data entry errors. Outliers also affect the accuracy of the results and lead to over or underestimated resultant values. As missing values and outliers degrade the performance of the analytical data models, various research works have focused on finding and handling such values. This paper reviews the various aspects of missing values and outliers in the preprocessing phase of data analytics to enhance the accuracy of the data model.},

Therefore, the assessment of the data quality management maturity model is important because it will be the basis for making recommendations to improve data quality. The framework used in this study is the data quality framework by David Loshin and DQM DMBOK. Overall, the average of data quality maturity level is still at level 3 (defined). From the results of the data quality maturity level, a list of characteristic gaps that have not been implemented is obtained. The results of the gap mapping get several DQM activities based on DMBOK. This activity is described as several strategy recommendations for improving the quality of worker's wage and income data.},

abstract={In 2018, a total of 98 wind profile radars are stable and upload data to CMA. Based on the ” Data quality control and evaluation system of wind profile radar network (V1.0)” independently designed and developed by Meteorological Observation Center of CMA, the quality of data is evaluated and analyzed with the following contents: detection capabilities and data accuracy. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The effective detection height of over 80% of the wind profile radars in the whole network has met the design indicators. The main reasons causing non-compliance of the effective detection height are system failure and low system performance. (2) The data of wind profile radars is compared with the data of GRAPES forecasting field, more than 90% of the data participating in the evaluation is relatively accurate. After data quality control, the standard deviations of U and V components are both within 3.05 m/s, compared with the non-quality control, they are decreased by 19.3 % and 19.5 %,furthermore, they are decreased by 4.1 % and 2.9 % compared with 2017. The reasons leading to the poor accuracy of data mainly are system failure, system observation parameter setting errors and data non-compliance. Based on the above two assessments, 19 sites have poor data availability throughout the year, accounting for 19.4% of all the wind profile radars, and 18 sites have poor data availability during part time of the year. The factors that affect data quality have the following characteristics: the number of sites with low system performance has increased year by year; the system observation parameter setting errors and the system failure that can not be repaired for a long time remain; due to signal interference shutdown, the lack of observation data is serious. In the future, China will improve data quality and enhance the efficiency of data application by strengthening management of business operation at assessment sites and the equipment operation at non-assessment sites, upgrading equipments with low system performance, and improving data quality control algorithms and so on.},

abstract={Quality prediction is one of the key links of quality control. Benefitting from the development of digital manufacturing, manufacturing process data have grown rapidly, which allows product quality predictions to be made based on a real-time manufacturing process. A real-time quality control system (RTQCS) based on manufacturing process data is presented in this paper. In this study, the relationship between the product real-time quality status and processing task process was established by analyzing the relationship between the product manufacturing resources and the quality status. The key quality characteristics of the product were identified by analyzing the similarity of the product quality characteristic variations in the manufacturing process based on the big data technology, and a quality-resource matrix was constructed. Based on the quality-resource matrix, the RTQCS was established by introducing an association-rule incremental-update algorithm. Finally, the RTQCS was applied in actual production, and the performance of RTQCS was verified by experiments. The experiments showed that the RTQCS can effectively guarantee the quality of product manufacturing and improve the manufacturing efficiency during production.},

abstract={The amount of information needed to acquire knowledge on today's acquisition systems is growing exponentially due to more complex, higher resolution, software-intensive acquisition systems that need to operate in System-of-Systems (SoS), Family-of-Systems (FoS), Joint, and Coalition environments. Unfortunately, the tools and methods necessary to rapidly collect, aggregate, and analyze this information have not evolved as a whole in conjunction with this increased system complexity and, therefore, has made analysis and evaluation increasingly deficient and ineffective. The Test Resource Management Center's (TRMC's) vision is to build a DoD test and evaluation (T&E) knowledge management (KM) and analysis capability that leverages commercial big data analysis and cloud computing technologies to improve evaluation quality and reduce decision-making time. An evaluation revolution, starting with the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, is underway to ensure the T&E community can support the demands of next-generation weapon systems.The true product of T&E is knowledge ascertained through the collection of information about a system or item under test. However, the T&E community's ability to provide this knowledge is hampered by more complex systems, more complex environments, and the need to be more agile in support of strategic initiatives, such as agile acquisition and the 3rd Offset Strategy. This increased complexity and need for speed cause delayed analysis and problems that go undetected during T&E. The primary reason for these shortfalls is antiquated tools and processes that make data hard to locate, aggregate, and convert into knowledge. In short, DoD has not evolved its evaluation infrastructure as its weapon systems have evolved.Conversely, commercial entities, such as medical observation and diagnosis, electric power distribution, retail, and industrial manufacturing, have embraced agility in their methodologies while modernizing analytics capabilities to keep up with the massive influx of data. Raw physical sensors could provide data, higher-quality image or video cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, faster data collectors, more detailed point-of-sale information or digitized records, and ultimately is providing more data to analysts in size and complexity than ever before. As more data has become available, an interrelated phenomenon is the desire of analysts to ask more detailed questions about their consumers and their business infrastructure. To drive the process of implementing big data analytics, businesses have begun establishing analytics centers which either take pre-defined business cases and apply methods to address them or implement existing knowledge within the data architecture to create a higher level of awareness to business groups or the company at-large. To meet these demands, data storage and computation architectures have become more sophisticated, dozens of technologies were developed for large-scale processing (such as Apache Hadoop or GreenPlum), and streaming architectures which allow data to be processed and actioned on in real-time as it is collected have become commonplace. The net result of these commercial best practices is a solid foundation for the DoD to transform how it uses data to achieve faster, better, and smarter decisions throughout the acquisition lifecycle.},

abstract={Modern companies and institutions rely on data to guide every single decision. Missing or incorrect information seriously compromises any decision process. In previous work, we presented Deequ, a Spark-based library for automating the verification of data quality at scale. Deequ provides a declarative API, which combines common quality constraints with user-defined validation code, and thereby enables "unit tests for data". However, we found that the previous computational model of Deequ is not flexible enough for many scenarios in modern data pipelines, which handle large, partitioned datasets. Such scenarios require the evaluation of dataset-level quality constraints after individual partition updates, without having to re-read already processed partitions. Additionally, such scenarios often require the verification of data quality on select combinations of partitions. We therefore present a differential generalization of the computational model of Deequ, based on algebraic states with monoid properties. We detail how to efficiently implement the corresponding operators and aggregation functions in Apache Spark. Furthermore, we show how to optimize the resulting workloads to minimize the required number of passes over the data, and empirically validate that our approach decreases the runtimes for updating data metrics under data changes and for different combinations of partitions.},

abstract={The paper presents a study aimed at identifying the most widely occurring data quality issues that affect users’ experience with data and their reuse, and presence of which may not only disrupt the willingness to work with data but also cause losses for businesses. The list of defects is intended to be identified as a result of the following activities: first, the list of the most widely occurring data quality requirements and/or dimensions should be established by means of literature analysis. Second, given the diversity and quantity of different data quality requirements and dimensions, this list should be reduced by means of the brainstorming session and DELPHI analysis, which involves 12 experts. The validity of the resulting list should then be verified by applying these requirements to real-world data, more precisely, open government data, which are freely available to every stakeholder. This activity involves 30 users with advanced data quality knowledge. This allows us to define a list of key data quality issues. Both the data holder and the data user with higher degree of confidence can make use of it to make sure that the data are error-free and are a trusted source to be used without losses for business. These requirements serve as part of a specification for the web-based data quality analysis tool to be developed.},

abstract={Today, the challenge for the service operators is not only to attract and subscribe new users but to retain already subscribed users. To gain a competitive edge over other service operators, the operating personnel have to measure the services provided to their users and the network performance in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) at regular periods. By analyzing the information in these measurements, they can manage the quality of service, which helps to improve their service and network performance. But due to the heavy increase in the number of users in recent years, they find it difficult to elicit essential information from such a large and complex data to manage the QoS using the existing methods. It is here that the recently developed and more powerful data mining methods come in handy. In this paper we proposed how data mining methods can be used to manage the mobile network QoS. We describe three data mining methods: Rough Set Theory, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Self Organizing Map (SOM).},

abstract={With the rapid development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things, many researchers have probed into the study of learning analysis, trying to solve the problems of teaching by analyzing the learning behavior data from learning process. And in many learning behavior research, the sensor network usually consists of a host of mutually independent data sources, which can be used to monitor measured objects from multiple dimensions thereby obtaining the multi-source multi-modal sensory data. However, there still exist false negative readings, false positive readings and environmental interference, etc. Therefore, we propose a multi-source multimode sensory data acquisition method based on Date Quality(DQ). We first define the data quality in terms of four aspects-accuracy, integrity, consistency and instantaneity. Then, by the modeling there aspects respectively, we propose metrics to estimate the comprehensive data quality method of multi-source multi-mode sensory data. Finally, a data acquisition method is presented based on data quality, which selects a part of data sources for data transmission according to the given precision. This method aims at reducing the consumption of the sensory network on the premise of the data quality guarantee. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.},

abstract={Tenants assume various roles in the enterprise data center networks, requiring a differentiated Quality of Service (QoS), data quality and isolation guarantees among them. Traditionally, data storage and processing are handled in either distributed, or centralized manner. While distributed execution offers a higher horizontal scalability, it often comes with a trade-off of lack of centralized control, and hence often with a decreased accuracy and management efficiency. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers a global view of the entire data center network to a logically centralized controller. Hence, it provides the best of both worlds with minimal compromises: (i) scalability of the large-scale distributed systems. (ii) unified management capabilities of the traditional centralized systems. By deploying an extended SDN controller architecture, we attempt to enhance the data quality of stored and processed data and increase the QoS of the multi-tenanted data center network clouds.},

year={2020},
volume={},

abstract={Recent developments in Internet of Things have heightened the need for data sharing across application domains to foster innovation. As most of these IoT deployments are based on heterogeneous sensor types, there is increased scope for sharing erroneous, inaccurate or inconsistent data. This in turn may lead to inaccurate models built from this data. It is important to evaluate this data as it is collected to establish its quality. This paper presents an analysis of data quality as it is represented in Internet of Things (IoT) systems and some of the limitations of this representation. The paper then introduces the use of trust as a heuristic to drive data quality measurements. Trust is a well-established metric that has been used to determine the validity of a piece or source of data in crowd sourced or other unreliable data collection techniques. The analysis extends to detail an appropriate framework for representing data quality within the big data model. To demonstrate the application of a trust backed framework, we used data collected from a IoT deployment of sensors to measure air quality in which a low cost sensor was co-located with a gold reference sensor. Using data streams modeled based on a dataset from an IoT deployment, our initial results show that the framework's trust score are consistent with the accuracy measure of the machine learning models.},

Based on the current state of data quality for health decision support, the paper proposes a framework and model for health data quality management and control. And a method of data quality inspection, processing and assessment applicable for the health data with complex types is designed based on the proposed model. On the one hand, it defines the inspection model of the semi-structured health data, designs the quick calling strategy of the inspection rules, and makes clear the data quality inspection method and problematic data processing method. On the other hand, it proposes a mathematic model for objective and quantitative evaluation of the health data.

abstract={Amidst various quality assurance agencies seeking evidence of compliance in different reporting formats, the university in this particular case, finds itself seeking for efficient ways to generate and make use of data and consequently bring the organisation beyond a mere compliance culture to a continuous improvement culture. Aware of the different operational contexts of its units and disciplines, a project was carried out not to centralise or make uniform its operations but to find a common ground to see how these units collectively contribute to the attainment of institutional goals. The project measured its success on the degree of data integration, efficiency of data visualisation and the availability of action plans generated out of the visualised data. From the level of success attained, a retrospection was made to determine the impediments encountered. The analysis revealed causes ranging from the nature of the data requirements, how the integration project was operationalised, and the remaining issues despite the deployed integration procedure, organisational factors, hardware requirements and system compatibility. It concluded with key points necessary to not only celebrate the project success but also for the next improvement cycle or related project initiatives. It also provided insights about the related operational processes and quality management system for the areas being covered.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={27-36},
abstract={Parallelizing data mining algorithms has become a necessity as we try to mine ever increasing volumes of data. Spatial data mining algorithms like Dbscan, Optics, Slink, etc. have been parallelized to exploit a cluster infrastructure. The efficiency achieved by existing algorithms can be attributed to spatial locality preservation using spatial indexing structures like k-d-tree, quad-tree, grid files, etc. for distributing data among cluster nodes. However, these indexing structures are static in nature, i.e., they need to scan the entire dataset to determine the partitioning coordinates. This results in high data distribution cost when the data size is large. In this paper, we propose a dynamic distributed data structure, DD-Rtree, which preserves spatial locality while distributing data across compute nodes in a shared nothing environment. Moreover, DD-Rtree is dynamic, i.e., it can be constructed incrementally making it useful for handling big data. We compare the quality of data distribution achieved by DD-Rtree with one of the recent distributed indexing structure, SD-Rtree. We also compare the efficiency of queries supported by these indexing structures along with the overall efficiency of DBSCAN algorithm. Our experimental results show that DD-Rtree achieves better data distribution and thereby resulting in improved overall efficiency.},

We propose a QBD model incorporating processes to support Data quality profile selection and adaptation. In addition, it tracks and registers on a data provenance repository the effect of every data transformation happened in the pre-processing phase. We evaluate the data quality selection module using large EEG dataset. The obtained results illustrate the importance of addressing QBD at an early phase of Big Data processing lifecycle since it significantly save on costs and perform accurate data analysis.},

abstract={Tackling Data Quality issues as part of Big Data can be challenging. For data cleansing activities, manual methods are not efficient due to the potentially very large amount of data.. This paper aims to qualitatively assess the possibilities for using machine learning in the process of detecting data incompleteness and inaccuracy, since these two data quality dimensions were found to be the most significant by a previous research study conducted by the authors. A review of existing literature concludes that there is no unique machine learning algorithm most suitable to deal with both incompleteness and inaccuracy of data. Various algorithms are selected from existing studies and applied against a representative big (healthcare) dataset. Following experiments, it was also discovered that the implementation of machine learning algorithms in this context encounters several challenges for Big Data quality activities. These challenges are related to the amount of data particualar machine learning algorithms can scale to and also to certain data type restrictions imposed by some machine learning algorithms. The study concludes that 1) data imputation works better with linear regression models, 2) clustering models are more efficient to detect outliers but fully automated systems may not be realistic in this context. Therefore, a certain level of human judgement is still needed.},

A well-established process has resulted in eight manuals that provide specific quality control tests for a variety of U.S. IOOS core variables of interest. Specifically, the manuals address quality control (QC) for observations of dissolved oxygen, currents, waves, water levels, winds, temperature and salinity, ocean optics, and dissolved nutrients. Regional Associations within the U.S. are now working toward implementing these test procedures, which are also being incorporated by international ocean-observing organizations, the private sector, and manufacturers developing sensor improvements. The manuals are initially drafted and reviewed by a committee of subject matter experts. The resulting draft is distributed to the U.S. Regional Associations for a second round of reviews, followed by a third review from the wider international community. As such, the manuals represent the best processes desired by those who will implement the tests. An important aspect of the tests is the selection of thresholds and other test criteria by local operators, who are in the best position to understand and determine such limits. The tests are neither overly prescriptive nor overly generic and are designed to support a wide range of sensors and operator capabilities. Tests are identified as required, strongly recommended, or suggested, with test results falling into one of three categories: pass, suspect/of high interest, or fail. Test examples are provided in the manuals, and the instructions are sufficiently explicit for a programmer to use them to write software code for automated QC processes. The manuals are living documents. They are updated as the QARTOD project evolves and as input is received from operators, data users, and manufacturers. The dissolved oxygen, waves, and currents manuals received updates in 2015.},

abstract={Now a day's every second data is being generated rapidly through internet and hence for making proper decision has become a huge task. We are surrounded by data but starving for knowledge, to achieve more profits in business, knowledge plays a key role for decision makers. Data warehouse provides a feasible solution to manage data which should be elegant and accurate for proper analysis and decision making. The data which is collected from different sources may have dirty data, cleaning of data should be done before the data is loaded into warehouse in order to achieve quality data. Once the data have been cleaned it will produce precise results, when the data mining query is applied. Hence consistent data is essential and reliable for decision making. We proposed an algorithm which constructs a Decision for every attribute and Missing values are to be replaced with leaf Node values by which we can achieve more quality data on which mining techniques can be applied for a quality analysis.},

abstract={Big Data has grown significantly in recent years. This growth has led organizations to adopt Big Data Value Chains (BDVC) as the appropriate framework for unlocking the value to make suitable decisions. Despite its promising opportunities, Big Data raises new concerns such as data quality and security that could radically impact the effectiveness of the BDVC. These two essential aspects have become an urgent need for any Big Data project to provide meaningful datasets and reliable insights. In this contribution, we highlight the importance of considering data quality and security requirements. Then, we propose a coherent, unified framework that extends BDVC with security and quality aspects. Through quality and security reports, the model can self-evaluate and arrange tasks according to orchestration and monitoring process, allowing the BDVC to evolve at the organization pace and to align strategically with its objectives as well as to federate a sustainable ecosystem.},

abstract={Observational data are fundamental for scientific research in almost any domain. Recent advances in sensor and data management technologies are enabling unprecedented amounts of observational data to be collected and analyzed. However, an essential part of using observational data is not currently as scalable as data collection and analysis methods: data quality assurance and control. While specialized tools for very narrow domains do exist, general methods are harder to create. This paper explores the identification of data issues that lead to the creation of data tests and tools to perform data quality control activities. Developing this identification step in a systematic manner allows for better and more general quality control tools. As our case study, we use carbon, water, and energy fluxes as well as micro-meteorological data collected at field sites that are part of FLUXNET, a network of over 400 ecosystem-level monitoring stations. In an effort toward the release of a new global data set of fluxes, we are doing data quality control for these data. The experience from this work led to the creation of a catalog of issues identified in the data. This paper presents this catalog and its generalization into a set of patterns of data quality issues that can be detected in observational data.},

abstract={The overwhelming need to improve the quality of complex data structures in healthcare is more important than ever. Although data quality has been the point of interest in many studies, none of them has focused on the development of quantitative and explainable methods for data imputation. In this work, we propose a “smart” imputation workflow to address missing data across complex data structures in the context of in silico clinical trials. AI algorithms were utilized to produce high-quality virtual patient profiles. A search algorithm was then developed to extract the best virtual patient profiles through the definition of a profile matching score (PMS). A case study was conducted, where the real dataset was randomly contaminated with multiple missing values (e.g., 10 to 50%). In total, 10000 virtual patient profiles with less than 0.02 Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence were produced to estimate the PMS distribution. The best generator achieved the lowest average squared absolute difference (0.4) and average correlation difference (0.02) with the real dataset highlighting its increased effectiveness for data imputation across complex clinical data structures.},

title={A Data Quality Framework for Process Mining of Electronic Health Record Data},
year={2018},
volume={},

pages={12-21},
abstract={Reliable research demands data of known quality. This can be very challenging for electronic health record (EHR) based research where data quality issues can be complex and often unknown. Emerging technologies such as process mining can reveal insights into how to improve care pathways but only if technological advances are matched by strategies and methods to improve data quality. The aim of this work was to develop a care pathway data quality framework (CP-DQF) to identify, manage and mitigate EHR data quality in the context of process mining, using dental EHRs as an example. Objectives: To: 1) Design a framework implementable within our e-health record research environments; 2) Scale it to further dimensions and sources; 3) Run code to mark the data; 4) Mitigate issues and provide an audit trail. Methods: We reviewed the existing literature covering data quality frameworks for process mining and for data mining of EHRs and constructed a unified data quality framework that met the requirements of both. We applied the framework to a practical case study mining primary care dental pathways from an EHR covering 41 dental clinics and 231,760 patients in the Republic of Ireland. Results: Applying the framework helped identify many potential data quality issues and mark-up every data point affected. This enabled systematic assessment of the data quality issues relevant to mining care pathways. Conclusion: The complexity of data quality in an EHR-data research environment was addressed through a re-usable and comprehensible framework that met the needs of our case study. This structured approach saved time and brought rigor to the management and mitigation of data quality issues. The resulting metadata is being used within cohort selection, experiment and process mining software so that our research with this data is based on data of known quality. Our framework is a useful starting point for process mining researchers to address EHR data quality concerns.},

title={A Data-Characteristic-Aware Latent Factor Model for Web Services QoS Prediction},
year={2022},
volume={34},
number={6},
pages={2525-2538},
abstract={How to accurately predict unknown quality-of-service (QoS) data based on observed ones is a hot yet thorny issue in Web service-related applications. Recently, a latent factor (LF) model has shown its efficiency in addressing this issue owing to its high accuracy and scalability. An LF model can be improved by identifying user and service neighborhoods based on user and service geographical information. However, such information can be difficult to acquire in most applications with the considerations of information security, identity privacy, and commercial interests in a real system. Besides, the existing LF model-based QoS predictors mostly ignore the reliability of given QoS data where noises commonly exist to cause accuracy loss. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a data-characteristic-aware latent factor (DCALF) model to implement highly accurate QoS predictions, where ‘data-characteristic-aware’ indicates that it can appropriately implement QoS prediction according to the characteristics of given QoS data. Its main idea is two-fold: a) it detects the neighborhoods and noises of users and services based on the dense LFs extracted from the original sparse QoS data, b) it incorporates a density peaks-based clustering method into its modeling process for achieving the simultaneous detections of both neighborhoods and noises of QoS data. With such designs, it precisely represents the given QoS data in spite of their sparsity, thereby achieving highly accurate predictions for unknown ones. Experimental results on two QoS datasets generated by real-world Web services demonstrate that the proposed DCALF model outperforms state-of-the-art QoS predictors, making it highly competitive in addressing the issue of Web service selection and recommendation.},

abstract={The authors proposed a set of tools and procedures to perform a Telemedicine Quality Control process (TM-QC) to be submitted to the telemedicine (TM) manufacturers. The proposed tools were: the Informative Questionnaire (InQu), the Classification Form (ClFo), the Technical File (TF), the Quality Assessment Checklist (QACL). The InQu served to acquire the information about the examined TM product/service; the ClFo allowed to classify a TM product/service as belonging to one application area of TM. The TF was intended as a technical dossier of product and forced the TM supplier to furnish the only requested documentation of its product, so to avoid redundant information. The QACL was a checklist of requirements, regarding all the essential aspects of the telemedical applications, that each TM products/services must be met. The final assessment of the TM product/service was carried out via the QACL, by computing the number of agreed requirements: on the basis of this computation, a Quality Level (QL) was assigned to the telemedical application. Seven levels were considered, ranging from the Basic Quality Level (QL1- B) to the Excellent Quality Level (QL7-E). The TM-QC process resulted a powerful tool to perform the quality control of the telemedical applications and should be a guidance to all the TM practitioners, from the manufacturers to the expert evaluators. The quality control process procedures proposed thus could be adopted in future as routine procedures and could be useful in the assessing the TM delivering into the National Health Service versus the traditional face to face healthcare services.},

abstract={The Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) was proposed in 1997 as an initial step for establishing an integrated observation system for the global water cycle. The Enhanced Observing Period was conducted from October 2002 to December 2004, with satellite data, in-situ data, and model output data collected and available for integrated analysis. Under the framework of CEOP, the CEOP Asia-Australia Monsoon Project (CAMP) was organized and provided the in-situ dataset in the Asian region. CAMP included 13 different reference sites in the Asian monsoon region during Phase 1 (October 2002 to December 2004). These reference sites were operated by individual researchers for their own research objectives. Therefore, the various sites' data had important differences in observational elements, data formats, recording intervals, etc. This usually requires substantial manual data processing to use these data for scientific research which consumes a great deal of researcher time and energy. To reduce the time and effort for data quality checking and format conversion, the CAMP Data Center (CDC) established a Web-based quality control (QC) system. This paper introduces this in-situ data management and quality control system for the Asian region data under the framework of CEOP.},

abstract={A compression approach of power quality monitoring data based on two-dimension Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is presented to deal with huge data about power quality event detection. The monitoring data was truncated and recomposed in multiple cycles to transform the one-dimension data into the two-dimension data, which was a matrix in essence. The matrix was divided into some sub-blocks all of which were 8×8 matrices. These matrices were performed two-dimension DCT. The elements at the same location of all sub-matrices form a new matrix, and the elements were at the equivalent energy level. The energy levels of new matrices were measured by average energy, and quantitative matrix was obtained by a threshold of average energy. The new matrices and quantitative matrix were used to represent the monitoring data set.},

abstract={An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodes dynamically forming a temporary network without the use of any existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. Routing in ad-hoc network is a challenging issue. Big data analytics have been suggested for proper evaluation and decision making in routing and placement of ad hoc network nodes. This Paper analyses the performance of AODV and DSR routing protocols for the quality assurance metrics. The performance differentials of AODV and DSR protocols are analyzed using NS-2 which is the main network simulator, NAM (Network Animator) and compared in terms of scales applied on Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), in different environments specified by varying pause time, speed and number of nodes.},

abstract={At present, there are more than 60 million hospitalized surgeries each year in China, and hundreds of millions of medical data records have been accumulated. The diversity, speed and other characteristics make it confounding for perioperative medical data to comply with consistent standards, resulting in widespread quality problems. Many issues escape simple inspections because the data generated for surgeries are from multiple data streams. Hence perioperative medical data quality management platform is designed in this paper to unite data from multiple sources and address issues discovered from cross-referencing. By representing cross-referencing data rules with temporal logic, it implements a comprehensive work platform for data quality inspection, data quality control and data annotation of perioperative medical data.},

pages={205-214},
abstract={Sensible data analysis requires data quality control. An essential part of this is data profiling, which is the identification and assessment of data quality problems as a prerequisite for adequately handling these problems. Differentiating between actual quality problems and unusual, but valid data values requires the "human-in-the-loop" through the use of visual analytics. Unfortunately, existing approaches for data profiling do not adequately support the special characteristics of time, which is imperative to identify quality problems in time series data - a data type prevalent in a multitude of disciplines. In this design study paper, we outline the design, implementation, and evaluation of "Know Your Enemy" (KYE) - a visual analytics approach to assess the quality of time series data. KYE supports the task of data profiling with (1) predefined data quality checks, (2) user-definable, customized quality checks, (3) interactive visualization to explore and reason about automatically detected problems, and (4) the visual identification of hidden quality problems.},

pages={573-580},
abstract={Especially in highly flexible production systems, quality management is confronted with immense challenges. Data Analytics is regarded as a technology for coping with increasing complexity. Currently a lack of value-added orientation impairs the effectiveness of such initiatives. This is because the workers do not have the capabilities to process Data Analytics. One approach is to train these workers to enable them for this new technology. These experts are highly busy with their core tasks, so that the other approach is to reduce the complexity for the user of Analytics by providing an interface with a high and interactive usability to have a minimum of training efforts. Today the usage of Visual Management within the lean production paradigms is used to provide Key Performance Indicators and other static information to the workers in an analogue or even digital way. The main problem is that there is no possibility for the worker to analyze why Key Performance Indicators changed and to find the root causes for the development so that they can improve their processes based on the analysis they have done. This paper shows a concept how Visual Analytics can be applied to enable production and quality experts to perform their analysis directly at the value-added process and thus continuously improve process and product quality.},

title={Quality Control of Minerals Management Service - Oil Company ADCP Data at NDBC: A Successful Partnership Implementation},
year={2006},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-5},
abstract={The Minerals Management Service (MMS) requires that deep water oil drilling and production platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico collect and provide current profile data to the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). NDBC processes and displays the resulting currents on the NDBC website. NDBC has recently implemented quality control algorithms agreed upon by industry and the government. The resulting imagery and data, including quality control flags, are available on the publicly available NDBC website. The quality control algorithms and flags are presented and comparisons of the resulting files are described. Oil companies must collect current profile data when drilling wells or operating production platforms in water greater than 400 meters deep. They are required to collect the data at 20 minute intervals and transmit the data via FTP to NDBC. The data are received, decoded, and quality controlled at NDBC. The current profiles are then formatted in TEmperature Salinity and Current (TESAC) messages and transmitted over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). The data are also viewed over the NDBC website as columnar listings and current vector stick plots. In order to determine the quality control algorithms for the current profiles, a committee of oil company, industry, and government representatives determined an approach that includes both individual bin (depth level) and profile algorithms. The algorithms take advantage of the fact that the Teledyne RDI Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) collects error velocity, percent good statistics for 3 and 4 beams, and correlation matrices and echo amplitudes for each beam. The algorithms described in this presentation were then implemented and flags generated for each quality control test. A total of nine flags are assigned within the NDBC database. The flags indicate good data (3), suspect data (2), or bad (1) data. Only bad data are not reproduced or plotted on the NDBC real-time webpage. Results from the implementation are being reviewed, but a quick look indicates that the algorithms are returning accurate descriptions of the ADCP data. The stick plots of ocean current with depth are much "cleaner" following the quality control implementation. The implementation of the quality control algorithms was delayed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which impacted both the NDBC and the oil industry in the Gulf of Mexico. NDBC is now resubmitting past data files through the quality control algorithms to insure that all data at NDCB have been quality controlled. The results of this effort (including the quality control algorithms) are being shared with Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) partners in an effort to standardize quality control of oceanographic data},

abstract={With the upcoming growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is translated into millions of interconnected devices reporting a high volume of data coming from heterogeneous sources (sensors), it is necessary to assess the confidence of data in order to provide the system with trustable information that can be used to get real insights from the physical world and thus take proper decisions or actions over it. Having in mind that ensuring data quality is key to ease user engagement, acceptance of IoT services and large scale deployments [1], a new critical issue arises which is related to the quality of the data in IoT. Some applications might have a different definitions and indicators for data quality (DQ) and thus different threshold for acceptance of the data. In this work, we explore a smart city application in the field of environmental monitoring and identify the related DQ indicators that apply within this context. Our approach is evaluated over a real dataset retrieved from SIATA's citizen scientist low-cost sensor network, an air quality monitoring system that can be encompassed within the IoT paradigm and that is composed by more than 200 nodes deployed all over the Aburra Valley in Antioquia, Colombia. The results show that feasibility assessing data quality and importance data quality awareness for an IoT application, as a tool for it to take proper actions on the real world.

abstract={A USAF sponsored MITRE research team undertook four separate, domain-specific case studies about Big Data applications. Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the "truth about Big Data" is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another.},

The manipulation of such Big amount of data becomes more and more difficult because of its size and its variety. For better governance of organizations (decision making, data analysis, earnings increase …), data quality and data governance at present of Big data are two major pillars for the design of any system handling data within the organization. This explains the number of researches conducted as it constitutes a research subject with several gaps and opportunities. Many works were conducted to define and standardize Data Quality (DQ) and its dimensions, others were directed to design and propose data quality assessment and improvement models or frameworks. This work aims to recall the data quality principles starting by the needed background knowledge, then identify and compare the relevant taxonomies existing in the literature, next surveys and compares the available Data quality assessment and improvement approaches. After that, we propose a metamodel highlighting the main concepts of DQ assessment and we describe a generic process for DQ assessment and improvement. Finally, we evoke the main challenges in the field of DQ before and after the emergence of Big Data.},
